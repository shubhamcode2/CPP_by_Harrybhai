## Overview
This repository contains my implementations and exercises from the **C++ Complete Course** playlist by Code with Harry. This playlist is an excellent resource for both beginners and intermediate programmers who want to dive deep into the world of C++. Covering almost all the popular and essential topics in C++, this series serves as a comprehensive guide to mastering the language.

## Why This Playlist?
C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used for system software, game development, and competitive programming. This playlist is structured to help learners progress from basic to advanced concepts seamlessly, with each video building upon the previous one.

## Topics Covered
Below is a summary of the key topics covered in this playlist:

1. **Introduction to C++:**
   - History and applications of C++.
   - Setting up the development environment.
   - Basic syntax and structure.

2. **Control Flow:**
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`).
   - Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).

3. **Functions:**
   - Function declaration, definition, and invocation.
   - Inline functions and recursion.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Classes and objects.
   - Constructors and destructors.
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

5. **Standard Template Library (STL):**
   - Vectors, sets, maps, and algorithms.
   - Iterators and their usage.

6. **File Handling:**
   - Reading from and writing to files.
   - Streams and error handling.

7. **Advanced Concepts:**
   - Pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
   - Operator overloading.
   - Templates and exception handling.

8. **Practice Problems and Projects:**
   - Solving real-world problems using C++.
   - Mini-projects to consolidate learning.

## How I Completed This Playlist
I followed each video rigorously, coding along and pausing to solve the exercises provided. For every major topic, I created well-documented code files to practice and reinforce the concepts. Towards the end, I completed the mini-projects, which greatly enhanced my understanding of real-world applications.
